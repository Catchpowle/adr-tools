## Status

STATUS

## Background

### Context

ðŸ’¡ _Give the reader a broad overview of the landscape in which the proposed change is being built._

### Motivation

ðŸ’¡ _Explain the motivation for the change and why we should aim to address it._

### Requirements

ðŸ’¡ _A short list of bullet points of what the scope of the change is.
Note: It is often helpful to state explicitly what is not expected to be in the scope._

## Design

ðŸ’¡ _Given the background, explain the high-level idea of your proposed solution._

### System Architecture

ðŸ’¡ _Describe the system on a high level and put it into context. Diagram usually works great â€” e.g. [system context diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_context_diagram). Explain components and how they relate to each other._

### Communication

ðŸ’¡ \*Explain how the components communicate. Diagrams with some context usually work great â€” e.g. [data/control flow diagrams](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sdy9Au0Ibv3aseGZyIKNwivgqnaZ0FqF1mUgIzZY7ZIqppJeZVqUl3Iundy0qzwJLSMdFyA-oysP5YGv5pNYpI11m9A5AY0Oqdqj=s0).

If you already have a clear idea you can further sketch APIs and explain mechanics â€” e.g. Kafka/HTTP, protocol â€” e.g. JSON/Protobuf, REST/gRPC â€” and message schema for how components communicate.\*

## Data

ðŸ’¡ _Think about data in your design. Start with high-level entities and drill down to how the system works with the actual data when implemented._

### Model

ðŸ’¡ _Think about key entities in your design, which system owns them and how do they relate inside or across the systems._
_Hint: Don't think about database tables just yet!_

### Storage

ðŸ’¡ _Explain a bit more about any data storage considerations â€” databases or other storage affected, data model, formats, etc._

## Further Considerations

### Previous Art

ðŸ’¡ _Are there any previous attempts to solve this problem? Provide references, links, or further context._

### Alternative Approaches Considered

ðŸ’¡ _Were any alternatives considered as a solution to this problem? Provide a short description of the pros and cons of each._

### Open Questions

ðŸ’¡ _What questions are left open and would you like to discuss them with the audience?_

### Next Steps

ðŸ’¡ _Are you planning to call a design review meeting and start to code the prototype immediately, or are you hoping to have a broad discussion? Clarify your plan going forward._
