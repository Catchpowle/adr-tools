# 3. ESM

Date: 2022-06-29

## Status

Accepted

## Context

With typescript 4.7 come proper ESM modules.

ECMAScript modules are the official standard format to package JavaScript code for reuse. Modules are defined using a variety of import and export statements.

## Decision

Since this is a new project, there's no reason to _not_ go with the flow.

## Consequences

There's some changes to the way the project is set up.
Everything is described here, in [Typescript's official documentation](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-7-beta/#ecmascript-module-support-in-node-js)

However, some highlights:

We **must** import code with extensions and `.js` at that (even though the file's actual type is .ts)

`__dirname` and `__filename` are no longer available. Use this instead:
```typescript
import path from 'node:path';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url';

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);```
